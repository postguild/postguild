## Co-chairs

### Katie Mettler, News

Katie is the co-chair for news of the Post Guild, the union that represents The Washington Post newsroom where she works as a national general assignment reporter. She is also on the guild's bargaining committee. Like many others in guild leadership, her love for unions is a family thing.

Katie loves working for The Post, too, which is why she thinks fighting to make it the best possible version of itself is so important. Our company leads the industry with its journalism. It should also strive to set the example for how newsroom’s treat their journalists.

## Vice chairs

### Justin Moyer, News

Justin came to The Post as a copy aide in 2008 as we were winning Pulitzers and laying off longtime employees. He became a reporter not long after the Bezos sale, and was part of an organizing drive that brought more than 100 members into our union in the past two years.

Inspired by his grandfather, who helped unionize a Goodrich tire factory in Phoenixville, Pa., decades ago, Justin now serves as treasurer of our Local, helping make sure the hundreds of thousands of dollars in dues that Post members send to the union annually are well spent.

### Pat Jacob, Commercial

Pat has worked in The Post’s advertising department for more than 20 years, and has always been a Guild member. She has witnessed the collective power of union workers confronting and resolving problems in our workplace. “We are the true voice of fairness and have always been committed to helping our sisters and brethren when needed.”

## Secretary

### Hau Chu

Hau started at The Post in 2015 delivering papers and sorting mail as a copy aide, so he understands the needs of overlooked workers throughout the newsroom. He is now an editorial aide in Features and writes about interesting things to do around the District. As a devoted union member, he was part of the recent organizing effort to recruit and energize employees for a louder voice at the bargaining table.

## Chief Stewards

### Sarah Kaplan, News

Sarah is a science reporter and the Chief Steward for the guild, which means she’s responsible for recruiting new members and making sure that everyone can lean on the guild in times of need.

But she’s also eager to help make the Post a better and fairer place to work.

## Overnight chair

### Lynn Olson, Vice Chair for Nightside

Lynn started work at The Post in 2004 on the night news desk and moved to the night homepage team in 2009. She joined the Guild immediately after starting work at The Post, inspired by the example of her father, who was a union steward for the John Deere factory in her hometown. Growing up, she saw the importance of the union to her dad and the people he worked with, and she wanted to be part of advocating for her coworkers, just as he did for his.

Email her at [olsonldsm@gmail.com](mailto:olsonldsm@gmail.com).

## Chair Emeritus

### Fredrick Kunkle

Freddy Kunkle joined The Washington Post and the Guild in February 2000, as might be expected of the grandson of a union organizer who worked with Walter Reuther in Detroit. In 2009, he became the union’s co-chair for news — a role he served in for a decade. During that time, Freddy led bargaining committees that negotiated four collective bargaining agreements with both the Graham family and the Post’s current owner, Jeff Bezos.

He has covered cops, courts, government, Maryland and Virginia politics and transportation, and he has written features on topics ranging from luxury pet hotels to Santa’s firing. He contributed to coverage of Russia’s invasion of Georgia, the Arab Spring movement in Egypt, and the early days of the separatist conflict in Ukraine.
