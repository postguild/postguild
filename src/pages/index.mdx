It is the mission of the guild to compassionately and diligently advocate for the employees of The Washington Post. We do this by bargaining for a fair contract, offering guidance for navigating workplace disputes and serving as a sounding board for everyday challenges related to your healthcare, pay and quality of life at work.

Being a member of The Washington Post Guild means you love the institution enough to make it the best it can be. It means you are invested in the broader mission of our newsroom, to speak truth to power and advocate for those whose voices aren’t heard. It means you embrace and support the union’s efforts to foster a creative environment in which you can do your best work — for yourself, the readers and The Washington Post.

The Post Guild believes it is easier to do exceptional work when your work environment is exceptional, too. We are proud to be part of such a storied institution. But even great workplaces can be better, and it’s the guild’s job to help make that happen by:

- Ensuring employees have the support to continue reporting, producing, selling and marketing the award-winning journalism that positions The Washington Post as an industry leader.

- Challenging Post management, including publisher Fred Ryan and owner Jeff Bezos, to seize the opportunity to also lead the industry in the way it treats its employees — a mission that we believe aligns with the company’s “150-year-old startup” mindset.

- Advocating for a more diverse news organization, one that not only reflects our hometown community of Washington, D.C., but also our ever-evolving country and the people whose stories we are responsible for telling.

- Empowering Washington Post employees to influence the place they spend most of their waking hours.

- Fostering a sense of community, family and solidarity among staffers.

- Fighting not just for benefits that cater to the physical health of employees, but their mental health, too.

- Demanding better parental leave policies that more closely align with the policy’s at competing news organizations
