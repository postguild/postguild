The Washington Post Newspaper Guild has been a voice for employees at the company since 1934. We represent 1,000 people across the newsroom and in our commercial operations — including award-winning journalists and the talented marketing, advertising and printing plant staff that help readers and watchers find their work.

Every two years, The Post Guild forms a bargaining committee that sits at the table with Washington Post management to negotiate a fair contract that aims to reflect the priorities of Post employees. This is The Post Guild’s most critical job. In the off-season, our core leadership works with other members on a variety of committees to ensure Post employees feel empowered and that their ideas, challenges and voices are heard.

We’re proud to work at The Washington Post, a newsroom that leads the industry in quality journalism. The Post Guild is working to ensure our newsroom leads the way in how journalists should be treated, too.
