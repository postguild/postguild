# Contract highlights

The Post Guild bargaining committee spent more than a year negotiating our current contract, which expires in June 2020. It was a tough fight that yielded a solid contract, but there’s much we wanted that The Post refused to give us. We’ll do better next time — but we need your help.

We’ve compiled a round-up of new rights and key existing ones, along with the pages where you can find them in the contract:

- **NEW: You have the right to request a pay review from HR.** Pay inequity is a pervasive issue in our industry and newsroom, so during 2018 contract negotiations the Guild fought for a clause in the contract that empowers employees to ask for information about pay scales in their departments.
- **NEW: You get a Guild-negotiated cost of living raise.** Every year, Post management grants merit raises to about one-third of staffers. The pay increase in the contract guarantees that, even without a merit raise, all employees see an annual bump of at least \$780. (Page 15)
- **NEW: Your parental leave benefits have fewer restrictions.** Before this contract, parents who were both Post employees had to split their four weeks of paid leave. The Guild convinced The Post to eliminate that stipulation, though management refused to budge on other parental leave asks.
- **Shift workers earn extra for their nighttime hours.** For each shift worked that starts between 2 p.m. and 9:59 p.m., employees receive $6. For each shift that begins between 10 p.m. and 5:59 a.m., employees receive $7.50. This is not automatically added to your salary. You must manually enter your relevant shifts. (Page 15)
- **You are entitled to overtime pay and/or comp time.** Employees earning $1,352 per week or less ($70,304 per year) are entitled to time and a half pay for all hours worked beyond 40 in a week, with some exceptions. Anyone who earns more than \$1,352 per week is entitled to comp time for any day worked outside their regular weekly schedule. (Page 20)
- **You have the right to opportunities for advancement.** The Post must publish notices of all job openings and give first consideration to current employees. If you are not selected for a promotion or transfer, you have the right to request an explanation for the decision and guidance about whether you would be considered for such a job in the future. (Pages 17 and 18)
