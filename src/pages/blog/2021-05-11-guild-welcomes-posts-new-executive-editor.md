Members of the Washington Post Guild send our heartfelt congratulations to Sally Buzbee on being named The Post's new executive editor. We look forward to working with her to build a stronger and more diverse newsroom in which staff are empowered to produce their best work. In this dynamic and challenging time for journalism, we hope our new editor will seek out the insight and expertise of employees as she charts a course for The Post's future. Guild leadership invite Sally to meet with us in the coming weeks to discuss her vision for the newsroom and how the Guild can be a partner in those efforts.
