**How many hours should I be working?**

The Washington Post workweek is **37.5 hours over the course of five days**, or 7.5 hours per day (not including a lunch break). Employees should not be required to work on days outside their normal schedule.

**Am I eligible for overtime?** 

Most employees earning $1,352 per week or less ($70,304 per year) are entitled to extra pay for working overtime or on holidays.

* If you work more than 40 hours in a week, you must be paid 1.5 times your regular salary for every hour beyond 40 worked that week.
* If you work on a Post-designated holiday, you must be paid 1 and 7/8ths times your regular salary for every hour worked.

Eligible employees must fill out their time sheets on Workday to ensure they receive their overtime pay*.If your manager tries to deny your overtime request, or instructs you to fill out your timesheet inaccurately, please contact the Guild.* This is a violation of the contract and could be subject to a grievance.

**The following positions are exempt from overtime requirements, regardless of salary.**

In the Newsroom:

* Editorial writers
* Cartoonists
* Columnists
* Critics
* Producers
* Writers and photographers covering professional or college sports that require them to travel for at least one night
* Reporters on out-of-town assignments
* Political writers covering campaigns, speaking tours, etc.
* Foreign correspondents

In Commercial:

* Display and outside sales representatives
* Acquisition sales executives

**Am I eligible for comp time?**

Anyone who is not eligible for overtime pay is entitled to comp time for working on holidays or any day outside their regular weekly schedule.

* For example, a local reporter whose normal schedule is Tuesday through Saturday but is asked to work on a Monday should receive one additional day off.
* Overtime-exempt staffers who work on any of the eight Post-designated holidays are entitled to pay for the day worked plus a comp day. They should also receive additional compensation worth seven-eighths of the maximum daily rate for overtime-eligible employees — equal to about $118.

Many departments prefer to handle comp time “off the books,” especially for salaried employees who do not regularly fill out timesheets. This informal approach is acceptable so long as managers actually allow employees to take the days off to which they are entitled.The Guild encourages employees to record their hours to hold their bosses accountable.If a manager tries to prevent you from taking comp time, or if they keep giving you so much work you are unable to take advantage of your comp time, please contact the Guild.

**What are The Post’s designated holidays?**

The Post recognizes eight federal holidays: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, President’s Day, Memorial Day, July Fourth, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day. In addition, employees are given two personal days to celebrate cultural and faith traditions or any other day of significance.

* Staffers who are eligible for overtime pay should receive 1 and 7/8ths their normal salary for every hour worked on a holiday
* Staffers who are not eligible for overtime should be paid for the day worked and receive one comp day plus additional holiday pay.

**What counts as time worked?**

You don’t have to be sitting at your desk in the office to be working. Employees are considered “at work” and entitled to pay or comp time in the following circumstances:

* While traveling to and from assignments
* While attending trainings or professional development programs mandated by the company
* While “on call,” if being on call significantly interferes with the employee’s ability to enjoy their day off

**Am I eligible for shift pay?**

Workers are eligible to earn an extra $6 for every shift that starts between 2pm and 9:59pm and an extra $7.50 for every shift that starts between 10pm and 5:59am. Eligible employeesmust fill out their time sheetsto ensure they receive their night shift differential.
