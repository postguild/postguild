## Co-chairs

### K﻿athleen Floyd

K﻿athleen has been at The Post for 6 years working on the Public Relations team. She's worn a few hats in the Guild the last few years, including Contract Action Team leader and steward, helping to plan the 2023 strike. She's excited to be able to serve as co-chair for the next few years. She grew up in the Los Angeles area (Pasadena for all you college football fans) and has been in D.C. for just about 10 years.

### Jacob Brogan

Jacob has been with The Post since 2018, originally as an editor with Outlook, and now on the Book World team in Features. It’s truly a dream job for him, not least of all because he used to be an English professor. He's been a steward for years, but is delighted to be taking on a new role in the Guild now. He lives in D.C. with a full closet and an unsustainable number of books. 

## Chief Steward

### K﻿allie Gregg

Kallie has been at the Post for two years, working as a senior program manager in custom advertising solutions. After helping organize the new union at the Atlantic, she was thrilled to join a shop with such a rich history and depth of membership. She's honored to now help steward (sorry, couldn’t resist) it into a new era. She's a Northern California girl living in Brooklyn; outside of work she's busy trying to visit every movie theater in the five boroughs, convincing herself she likes the East Coast beaches just as well as the West Coast, and ranking the city’s selection of almond croissants.

## S﻿ecretary

### V﻿anessa Larson

joined The Post as a news multiplatform editor a little over four years ago; before that, I spent nearly four years at the now-defunct Washington Post Express, where I was copy chief. I've been a Guild steward involved with recruiting and keeping track of membership data since 2022, and was an MPED captain for the walkout. A D.C. native, I previously spent about seven years in Turkey as a freelancer before returning to the area and settling in Silver Spring, where I live with my husband and cat.
