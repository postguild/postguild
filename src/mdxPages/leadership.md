## Co-chairs

### Katie Mettler, News

Katie is the co-chair for news of the Post Guild, the union that represents The Washington Post newsroom where she works as a national general assignment reporter. She is also on the guild's bargaining committee. Like many others in guild leadership, her love for unions is a family thing.

Katie loves working for The Post, too, which is why she thinks fighting to make it the best possible version of itself is so important. Our company leads the industry with its journalism. It should also strive to set the example for how newsroom’s treat their journalists.

## Chair Emeritus

## Fredrick Kunkle

Freddy Kunkle joined The Washington Post and the Guild in February 2000, as might be expected of the grandson of a union organizer who worked with Walter Reuther in Detroit. In 2009, he became the union’s co-chair for news — a role he served in for a decade. During that time, Freddy led bargaining committees that negotiated four collective bargaining agreements with both the Graham family and the Post’s current owner, Jeff Bezos.

He has covered cops, courts, government, Maryland and Virginia politics and transportation, and he has written features on topics ranging from luxury pet hotels to Santa’s firing. He contributed to coverage of Russia’s invasion of Georgia, the Arab Spring movement in Egypt, and the early days of the separatist conflict in Ukraine.
