## Co-chairs

### K﻿athleen Floyd

K﻿athleen has been at The Post for 6 years working on the Public Relations team. She's worn a few hats in the Guild the last few years, including Contract Action Team leader and steward, helping to plan the 2023 strike. She's excited to be able to serve as co-chair for the next few years. She grew up in the Los Angeles area (Pasadena for all you college football fans) and has been in D.C. for just about 10 years.

### Jacob Brogan

Jacob has been with The Post since 2018, originally as an editor with Outlook, and now on the Book World team in Features. It’s truly a dream job for him, not least of all because he used to be an English professor. He's been a steward for years, but is delighted to be taking on a new role in the Guild now. He lives in D.C. with a full closet and an unsustainable number of books.
