K﻿athleen has been at The Post for 6 years working on the Public Relations team. She's worn a few hats in the Guild the last few years, including CAT leader and steward, helping to plan the 2023 strike. She grew up in the Los Angeles area (Pasadena for all you college football fans) and has been in D.C. for just about 10 years.

been with The Post since 2018, originally as an editor with Outlook, and now on the Book World team in Features. It’s truly a dream job for me, not least of all because I used to be an English professor. I’ve been a steward for years, but I’m delighted to be taking on a new role in the Guild now. I live in Logan Circle with a full closet and an unsustainable number of books.
