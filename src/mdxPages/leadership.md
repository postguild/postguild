## Co-chairs

### K﻿athleen Floyd

K﻿athleen has been at The Post for 6 years working on the Public Relations team. She's worn a few hats in the Guild the last few years, including Contract Action Team leader and steward, helping to plan the 2023 strike. She's excited to be able to serve as co-chair for the next few years. She grew up in the Los Angeles area (Pasadena for all you college football fans) and has been in D.C. for just about 10 years.

### Jacob Brogan

Jacob has been with The Post since 2018, originally as an editor with Outlook, and now on the Book World team in Features. It’s truly a dream job for him, not least of all because he used to be an English professor. He's been a steward for years, but is delighted to be taking on a new role in the Guild now. He lives in D.C. with a full closet and an unsustainable number of books. 

## Chief Steward

### K﻿allie Gregg

Kallie has been at the Post for two years, working as a senior program manager in custom advertising solutions. After helping organize the new union at the Atlantic, she was thrilled to join a shop with such a rich history and depth of membership. She's honored to now help steward (sorry, couldn’t resist) it into a new era. She's a Northern California girl living in Brooklyn; outside of work she's busy trying to visit every movie theater in the five boroughs, convincing herself she likes the East Coast beaches just as well as the West Coast, and ranking the city’s selection of almond croissants.

## **S﻿ecretary**

### **V﻿anessa Larson**

Vanessa joined The Post as a news multiplatform editor a little over four years ago; before that, she spent nearly four years at the now-defunct Washington Post Express, where she was copy chief. She’s been a Guild steward involved with recruiting and keeping track of membership data since 2022, and was an MPED captain for the 2023 strike. A D.C. native, she previously spent about seven years in Turkey as a freelancer before returning to the area and settling in Maryland, where she lives with her husband and cat.

## **Vice Chair, Mobilization**

### **Gaby Morera Di-Núbila**

Gaby has been a multiplatform editor at The Post since 2022. Before that she worked at the New York Times, where she joined a union for the first time. She was a walkout captain for the 2023 strike, working to mobilize the copy editors. She’s originally from Puerto Rico, where they literally ousted their governor via mass protest. Usually you can find her reading a book, watching old episodes of Survivor or picking up a new hobby.

## **Vice Chair, Recruitment**

### **Jesse Dougherty**

Jesse has been at the Post since early 2017, when he started as a high school sports reporter. He’s since covered University of Maryland (very, very briefly), the Nationals (for five years) and now write college sports features with a focus on business. He lives with his wife in D.C and his hobbies include reading and photographing their cat, though he’s also on the hunt for more hobbies. He grew up near Philadelphia and went to Syracuse, where it was really cold.

## **Vice Chair, Communications**

### **Hannah Good**

Hannah is currently a Designer at The Post focused on [comics and illustrated reporting](https://postguild.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1555510c445bcea6e8977fa6a&id=28df6694bd&e=9572ab4c56). She’s been at The Post for three years on various teams, including Next Gen and The Lily. She’s a comics artist herself, and you might have seen some of her comics and zines, as well as her work co-launching the [Guild Instagram](https://postguild.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1555510c445bcea6e8977fa6a&id=3be1e035d6&e=9572ab4c56) and assisting with comms in the past as a member of the Contract Action Team. She’s proud to be from Kentucky (a state whose history inspired her love of labor rights), and she lives in D.C. with my bunny Emmylou.

## **Vice Chair, Health and Safety**

### **Ariel Plotnick**

Ariel has worked as an audio producer at the Post for 5 years — she’s had the great pleasure of adapting many Post reporter’s incredible print and multimedia stories into episodes of Post Reports. For the past few years, she’s been active on the Mental Wellness Team, and she was a walkout captain for our awesome strike. She’s from Philly, and likes to spend her weekends trying new restaurants with her husband, and hanging with her sweet cat Finn.
