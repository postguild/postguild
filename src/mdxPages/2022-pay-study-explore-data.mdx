  As a follow-up to our 2019 pay study, we once again examine compensation at The Washington Post by race, gender, age and department. But this report goes a step further, using demographic data provided by the company and obtained by the Guild to explore diversity and retention at the organization.

One of the Guild's primary motivations for publishing employee pay data is empowering our members to use the information they find in the report to advocate for themselves and their colleagues. Pay transparency empowers workers â€” so we built an interactive that allows Post employees to further explore pay in their corner of the company.
