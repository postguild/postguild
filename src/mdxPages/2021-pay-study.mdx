title: A STUDY OF PAY AT THE WASHINGTON POST
byline: By members of the Washington Post Newspaper Guild
description: >-
  The Post has never conducted and released to the public a comprehensive pay study of its own. So this year, Post Guild decided to do one itself.

  Our union contract with Post management mandates that the company give us pay data on Guild-covered employees on an annual basis. We requested this information in July 2019 and spent four months analyzing the data, a reporting effort led by Pulitzer Prize-winning data journalist Steven Rich and supported by a team of dozens of other Post Guild members. We took care to protect the integrity of the data and the privacy of our members.

  The result of those efforts is this new report — the most comprehensive study to date of pay at The Washington Post.
